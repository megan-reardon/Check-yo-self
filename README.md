# Check-yo-self

The Check-yo-self project is the final solo project at Turing during Mod 1, and is designed to demonstrate that you are ready to start Module 2. The expectation is to build an app that lets the user create multiple checklists of to-do tasks, check off completed items, and filter their tasks by urgency.

## Team Members
* [Megan Venetianer](https://github.com/megan-venetianer)

## Learning Goals
*Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  *DRY JavaScript
  *localStorage to persist data
*Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
*Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Set Up
1. Clone this repository
2. Run open index.html in the terminal command line
3. Add a couple of task items
4. Make your new task list
5. Check off items and mark as urgent
6. Use the search bar to search for specific task lists/items


## Challenges
* Building the app in a limited time frame
* Trying to write JS that was as DRY as possible

## Wins
* Developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between the data model and events on the DOM
* Utilizing local storage appropriately to ensure items were persisting on the page
